An algorithm created to compute the log ratio of radar images using GDAL and OpenMP
The program curently accepts the input created from the georeferencer after image calibration.

Usage: LogRatio image1 image2 polarization threshold output_file

polarization values: VV or VH

output file should be in .tif format
